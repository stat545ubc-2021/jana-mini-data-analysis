# 0 Introduction

This file goes through my exploration of different data sets in the `datateachr` package. I will look at 7 data sets as described [here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/). I will be documenting how I choose my final data set and then I will perform various data exploration techniques to this data set in order to create 4 research questions motivated by the exploration.

# 1 Choose Favorite Data set

### 1.1 Choose 4 Data sets

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
```

From an initial pass through of the description of the data, I am most interested in the following 4 data sets:

1. *apt_buildings*
2. *building_permits*
3. *parking_meters*
4. *vancouver_trees*

### 1.2 Narrowing Down choices

### 1.3 Choose 2 Data sets

### 1.4 Final Data set

# 2 Exploring the Data set
