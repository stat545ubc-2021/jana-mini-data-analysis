# Introduction

This file goes through my exploration of different data sets in the `datateachr` package. I will look at 7 data sets as described [here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/). I will be documenting how I choose my final data set and then I will perform various data exploration techniques to this data set in order to create 4 research questions motivated by the exploration.
