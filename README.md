## Project Deliverables

Below are brief descriptions of each milestone in this project, along with a checked box if the milestone was completed.

**Milestone 1** (complete)

October 9, 2021
This milestone focusses on exploring the datasets found in the `datateachr` package. I eventually narrow down to one dataset, in this case, I choose the *apt_buildings* dataset. I explore the data and formulate 4 research questions.

This milestone focusses on further exploring the research questions formulated in Milestone 1 by using various plotting and summarizing techniques shown in class. I reflect on my progress on the research questions. Lastly, I explore if the data is tidy or not.
