# 0 Introduction

This file goes through my exploration of different data sets in the
`datateachr` package. I will look at 7 data sets as described
[here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/). I will
be documenting how I choose my final data set and then I will perform
various data exploration techniques to this data set in order to create
4 research questions motivated by the exploration.

# 1 Choose Favorite Data set

### 1.1 Choose 4 Data sets

From an initial pass through of the description of the data, I am most
interested in the following 4 data sets:

1.  *apt\_buildings*
2.  *building\_permits*
3.  *parking\_meters*
4.  *vancouver\_trees*

### 1.2 Narrowing Down choices

### 1.3 Choose 2 Data sets

### 1.4 Final Data set

# 2 Exploring the Data set
