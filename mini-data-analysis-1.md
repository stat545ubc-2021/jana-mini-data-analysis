# Introduction

This file goes through my exploration of different data sets in the
`datateachr` package. I will look at 7 data sets as described
[here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/). I will
be documenting how I choose my final data set and then I will perform
various data exploration techniques to this data set in order to create
4 research questions motivated by the exploration.
